# Media_Company
We have data-set related to a particular show of a media company (like Hot star)  and we need to predict the no of viewers (Regression Problem).
Dataset has 7 features(rows- including views) + 1(Garbage) and 80 datapoints(columns).

Date :- This is used to derive a new features called Days and Weekends.
        Days :- As the no of days increases the no of views increases upto certain point and then declined towards end.
        weekends :- we found that saturday and sunday has maximum views.
        
Ad_impression :- we found that advertisement has large impact on views.

Cricket_match_india :- we have imbalanded dataset for this (non_cricket_match_day and cicket_match_day), it was hard to identify but we                          could say views declined on match day.
